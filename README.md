# CanSat IMU data visualizer
This repository aims to create a visualizer of the movement, position and orientation of a CanSat through its IMU data.

The visualizer is based upon the VPython library, which displays 3D graphics through web browsers. The objective is displaying in real-time the CanSat's movements, as well as monitor history movement, probably through graphs and serial monitoring.
